        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Long, thin pasta, such as: spaghetti, linguine, buccatini.</li>
            <li>Fresh sea scallops and jumbo shrimp (raw).</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil and unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Aromatics: garlic, anchovies, lemon, red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry the scallops. Place sea scallops on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess moisture. Place a second paper towel on top, pressing very gently on top of the scallops. Let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil, then season with Kosher salt. Cook pasta according to package directions till al dente. Reserve 1 cup of cooking liquid, then drain pasta.</li>
            <li>Sear scallops. While pasta is cooking, heat 4 Tbsp butter and 2 Tbsp oil over high heat in a large skillet. Season scallops and shrimp on both sides with salt and pepper. When hot, add scallops to the pan and cook, undisturbed, for 1-2 minutes, just until a golden brown crust has formed. Flip scallops, then cook an additional 1 minute. Remove to a tray.</li>
            <li>Cook shrimp. Turn the heat down to medium-high, then add shrimp to the pan. Cook about 1-2 minutes per side, just until shrimp are opaque. Transfer to tray with scallops.</li>
            <li>Char the lemon. Cut 1 lemon into thin slices about ¼” thick. Add lemon to the pan, then cook until charred, about 1 minute per side. Remove to the tray with seafood.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce. Add another 2 Tbsp each of olive oil and unsalted butter, then add minced garlic, anchovies, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes. Cook, breaking up the anchovies with the back of a wooden spoon, until melted into the sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add pasta. Pour in the drained, cooked pasta, along with ½ cup reserved cooking liquid. Stir to thoroughly coat pasta in the lemon garlic pasta sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately. Add seafood and cooked lemon slices back to the skillet, then stir in freshly grated Parmesan cheese and finely chopped fresh parsley. Serve with a pinch of flaky sea salt, then garnish with additional cheese and herbs as desired.</li>
        
        </ol>
